Inorder to run the simulation and obtain results
1) Copy the file named mmwave.cc into the scratch directory of ns3
2) (Optional) Make changes to the naming parameters in the mmwave.cc file consistent with the naming scheme outlined below
3) Navigate to the parent directory of scratch and in the command line type the command: ./waf --run mmwave
4) (Optioal) Run Parser.java making changes to the file and folder name in the program to supply the MmWaveSinrTime file, generated by ns3 by default, 
for converting to an excel ready csv file.
 
Naming Scheme:
The folder named simulation Runs contains generated data files for the simulations. They follow a certain naming scheme: 
if the filename starts with the prefix b then the simulation contains buildings and if it starts with nb then it does not contain buildings.
If the word large follows the prefix then the distance between the buildings is 2000 m and if the prefix is followed by the word small then
the separation is 200 m. The letter v and the number specifies the version of the scenario you are running and the type of the algorithm 
follows this number. The naming ends with the speed with which the UE travels in the scenario.

A code review presentation is also included with the file to help navigate the code.
